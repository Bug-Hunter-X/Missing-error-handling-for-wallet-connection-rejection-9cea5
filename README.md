# Missing Error Handling in Wallet Connection

This example demonstrates a common error in DApps: insufficient error handling during wallet connection.  The `checkIfWalletIsConnected` function only checks for the absence of a wallet but fails to handle the case where the user denies permission.

The solution addresses this by properly handling the promise rejection and providing feedback to the user.
